Once you have git and the correct version of Unity installed, here's how to install the project via commandline.
Make sure you are in the directory you want to install the project to.

Type:
#+BEGIN_SRC
git clone https://github.com/br15cr/MonsterMeld.git
#+END_SRC
and press enter.

The project will start in the *master* branch by default.

To change the current branch, we must first have the project as our current directory.

:
#+BEGIN_SRC
cd MonsterMeld
#+END_SRC

This tells git to clone the project to your computer. The project will start on the *master* branch.
